#usePopCorn: Movie Rating and Watchlist App

Built a movie rating and watchlist application that allows users to browse movies fetched from the OMDb API, rate them, and add them to a personalized watched list. The app enhances the user experience by letting users track and rate movies theyâ€™ve watched and discover new films based on ratings.
